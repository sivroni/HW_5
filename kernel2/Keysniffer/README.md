# keysniffer
A Linux kernel module to grab keys pressed in the keyboard, or a keylogger. Works with the US keyboard (and conforming laptops).

The keypress logs are recorded in debugfs as long as the module is loaded. Only root or sudoers can read the log. The module name has been camouflaged to blend-in with other kernel modules.

You can, however, execute a script at shutdown or reboot (the procedure would be distro-specific) to save the keys to a file.

keysniffer is intended to track your own devices and NOT to trespass on others. The author has never usesd it to compromise someone else's system and is not responsible for any unethical application.
